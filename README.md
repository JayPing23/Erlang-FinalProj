IT/CS 311 Final Project Team Collaboration Tools

Objectives. The team must be able to:
      ● Demonstrate how code review, issue tracking, and continuous integration & continuous
        delivery/deployment (CI/CD) are done in the software development process.
      ● Utilize online tools having features to facilitate the aforementioned activities.
      ● Develop/enhance group dynamics.
      ● Enhance presentation skills.
      
Requirements:
      Your team must identify an online platform that will allow the team to perform the following
      activities: code review, issue tracking, and optionally CI/CD.
      The group project will involve a repository that will be used to demonstrate the activities
      mentioned. On top of the repository used for the demonstration, the team must maintain
      another repository where a history of the activities will be observable. As a guide for the details
      to be performed for the identified activities, you may refer to the list below on the specific tasks
      under each activity. Note, however, that you can go beyond the following tasks and that you
      have the freedom to demonstrate these activities with a given workflow/choreography.
      
Code review:
      ● View history of changes in a repository
      ● Navigate within a project
      ● Compare revisions
      ● Inspect the program files using static code analysis
      ● Request code review (author)
      ● Review teammate changes (reviewer)
      ● Monitor changes introduced by teammates (watcher/spectator)
      
Issue tracking:
      ● Issue creation and tracking
      ● Task/Issue assignment to member
      ● Monitor task status
      ● Reporting and analytics
      
CI/CD:
      ● Automated build
      ● Code Quality analysis
      ● Artifact repository
      ● Deployment to staging/testing
      ● Automated testing
