view_history(Repo) ->
    % Fetch and return the history of changes in the repository
    % This would typically interface with a database
    ?COMMIT_DB.

compare_revisions(Repo, Revision1, Revision2) ->
    % Compare two revisions
    %% Here you would implement logic to compare code
    {ok, "Comparison result"}.

request_review(Repo, CommitId, Reviewer) ->
    % Request a code review
    ReviewRequest = #review_request{commit_id = CommitId, reviewer = Reviewer, status = pending},
    %% Store ReviewRequest in database
    {ok, ReviewRequest}.

review_changes(Repo, ReviewRequest) ->
    % Logic to review changes
    %% Update status of ReviewRequest
    {ok, "Review completed"}.
